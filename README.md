This project is a GUI for delivery driver app that will plan the route for delivery. The app chose the route on which route will give the least amount of waiting minutes over 30 minutes.
The Algorithms used are modified version of furthest insertion and 2 opt to solve the problem.
The input to the app must be in the order of order number,adress, time since order,latiude,longitude.
This app was designed to go from Apache pizza in Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland so the co-ordinates to show on map need to between latiudes 53,41318 and 53,2827 and the longitudes -6,71261 and -6,45509.
The output Panel will print out the route by their order numbers.
Red dots represent stops where the customer is waiting over 30 mins and green dots is where the customer was waiting under 30 minutes.
The black sqaure represent apache pizza
